# irgiob.github.io

This is a portfolio website I made to show the projects I've done here on Github
in a more visual medium.

Although the website was built off a template by TEMPLATED, extensive modifications
have been made to make the website better suit my personal tastes.

## Changes made
* Added typing animation to main title
* Switched the places of section two and three
* Completely changed section three from an image gallery to resume information section
* Added animations to section two that make the images change and become bigger
* Removed nav bar
* Added skills bars to section three
* Extensive changes to CSS
* Added a Dark Mode toggle
